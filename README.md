## Overview
This project was developed as a requirement for the completion of the Machine Learning course in a master's degree program. The objective was to compare and evaluate different machine learning models for both classification and regression tasks. Two separate datasets were provided for each task, and the goal was to select the best-performing model based on their performance metrics.

## Classification Models
For the classification task, three different models were compared using the provided dataset. The aim was to identify the best model among them. The models that were evaluated are as follows:

* Model 1: Simple Logit (accuracy: 79-81 %)
* Model 2: XGBoost (accuracy: 94-95 %)
* Model 3: SVM (accuracy: 80-81 %)
* Model 4: KNN (accuracy: 69-70 %)
After careful evaluation and analysis of the performance metrics, the best classification model was determined. For more detailed accuracy and metrics, please refer to the attached PDF presentation.

## Regression Models
Similarly, for the regression task, three different models were compared using the provided dataset. The objective was to identify the most suitable model based on their performance. The models that were evaluated are as follows:

* Model 1: Simple Regression (MAPE : 12,41 %)
* Model 2: RidgeLasso (MAPE : 12,71 %)
* Model 3: El Net (MAPE : 16 %)

By examining the performance metrics and analyzing the results, the best regression model was determined. For a more comprehensive understanding of the accuracy and metrics, please refer to the attached PDF presentation.

## Conclusion
In this project, we compared multiple machine learning models for both classification and regression tasks. After careful evaluation of the performance metrics, we determined the best model for each task. The detailed analysis and accuracy metrics can be found in the attached PDF presentation.
